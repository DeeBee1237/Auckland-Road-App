# Auckland-Road-App

This was a project from one of my courses at Victoria University (Comp 261).
We were provided with some starting code and had to extend the program a lot 
in order to get the app working. The Application works by reading in text files that
contain Auckland Road data, and rendering an image of the greater Auckland region onto the screen. 
The Map can be zoomed in and out, road names can be searched for in the search box, and highlighted 
on the screen. Users are able to click on any intersections, and the road names at that intersection are 
listed. 

Please note: While it was my code that provided the functionality of this app, I was given 
some code to start off with (all of the GUI was provided for me, etc)

If you would like to see this app working, please create a new Folder with all the non java files
and then select that folder when you choose load. (I included a small amount of data because I had trouble
uploading the larger one)
